      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3>Blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem:</strong>
              I was trying to figure out why a button on my website wasn't changing color when I hovered over it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem solving technique:</strong>
              I started by checking my CSS code to see if there were any typos or errors in the button's styling. 
              Then, I used the browser's developer tools to inspect the button and see if there were any conflicting styles or if the hover effect was being overridden by another rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> feelings throughout the process:</strong>
              Initially, I felt frustrated because I couldn't understand why such a simple thing wasn't working. 
              As I continued to investigate, I started to feel a bit discouraged because I couldn't find a solution right away.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong> What I learned:</strong>
              I learned the importance of being patient and methodical when troubleshooting. 
              Sometimes, even the simplest problems can be tricky to solve, and it's okay to take a step back and approach the problem from a different angle.
            </li>
         </ul>

      <h3>Elegantly Solved a problem:</h3>
    
         <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem:</strong>
              I needed to create a responsive layout for my website that would adjust its size and position based on the screen size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Problem solving technique:</strong>
              I used a combination of CSS media queries and flexbox to create a layout that would respond to different screen sizes. 
              I also tested the layout on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that it looked good and was functional across all platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> feelings throughout the process:</strong>
              I felt excited and motivated to solve the problem because I knew that creating a responsive layout would greatly improve the user experience of my website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> What I learned:</strong>
              I learned the importance of using the right tools and techniques for the job.
               By using CSS media queries and flexbox, I was able to create a responsive layout that met my needs and exceeded my expectations.
            </li>
         </ul>
     <h3>Reflect on problem-solving techniques:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
        When it comes to problem-solving, I feel confident in using pseudocode to outline the logic before coding and trying different approaches, seeing them as learning opportunities. 
        I find the rubber ducky method helpful for gaining new perspectives and am comfortable reading error messages and using console.logging for debugging. Googling for solutions is a common practice, and I don't hesitate to ask peers or coaches for help, valuing their insights. 
        Reflecting on my process helps me identify areas for improvement, making me a more effective problem solver overall.
      </li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Reluctance to ask for help:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>
        There was a time when I was reluctant to ask for help because I didn't want to appear incompetent or bother others with my problems. 
        However, I realized that asking for help is not a sign of weakness but rather a sign of humility and a willingness to learn.

       Next time, I would try to overcome my reluctance by reminding myself that asking for help is a normal and necessary part of the learning process. 
       I would also try to approach asking for help as an opportunity to learn from others and build stronger relationships with my peers and coaches.

     </ul>
