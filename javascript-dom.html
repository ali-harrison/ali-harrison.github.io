    <h1>Javascript - DOM</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>HTML</b> is like the list of ingredients. It provides the basic elements needed, like flour, sugar, and eggs, to create a dish.</li>
          <li><b>CSS</b> is like the presentation of the dish. It adds style and visual appeal, like the way the dish is plated and garnished.</li>
          <li><b>Javascript</b> is like the cooking instructions. It adds interactivity and functionality, like how the ingredients are mixed, cooked, and served.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Anology</b></h3>
       <li> Just as a recipe combines ingredients, presentation, and cooking instructions to create a delicious dish, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a functional and visually appealing website or web application.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Control flow - Loops</h3>
        <ul>
           <li><b>Control Flow:</b> Control flow is like the sequence of steps you take to make a sandwich. You start by gathering the ingredients, then you assemble the sandwich, and finally, you can choose to eat it or store it for later. Each step depends on the previous one, and you follow the steps in a specific order to make sure the sandwich is made correctly.</li>
           <li><b>Loops:</b> Loops are like the repetitive tasks you might do while making a sandwich. For example, if you're adding lettuce to your sandwich, you might repeat the process of picking up a piece of lettuce, placing it on the sandwich, and then picking up another piece until you've added enough lettuce. This repetitive process is similar to how loops work in programming, where you repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3><b>Anology</b></h3>
      <li>In this analogy, control flow represents the overall sequence of steps in making a sandwich, while loops represent the repetitive tasks you might perform during certain steps of the process.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>DOM</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a map that represents everything on a webpage. Each element on the page, like a heading or a paragraph, is a part of this map.

        Interacting with the DOM means using JavaScript to change or get information from these elements. For example, you can change the text inside a paragraph or change the color of a button when it's clicked.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
   <h3><b>Arrays - Objects</b></h3>
       
      <ul>
        <li><b>Arrays:</b> Arrays store data in a sequential manner, where each piece of data is assigned a numeric index starting from 0. To access data in an array, you use the index of the item you want to retrieve. For example, if you have an array called myArray with three elements, you can access the first element like this: myArray[0].</li>
        <li><b>Objects:</b> Objects store data in key-value pairs, where each piece of data (value) is associated with a unique key. To access data in an object, you use the key associated with the value you want to retrieve. For example, if you have an object called myObject with a key-value pair 'name': 'John', you can access the value 'John' like this: myObject['name'].</li>
       <h3>Summary</h3>
       <li>In summary, arrays use numeric indexes to access data, while objects use keys. Arrays are used when you have a collection of similar items that you want to access by their position in the array, while objects are used when you have a collection of key-value pairs and you want to access data by its key.</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
  <p>
      <h3>Functions</h3>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Save time:</b> Once you create a function, you can use it again and again without rewriting the same code.</li>
       <li><b>Make code easier to understand:</b> Functions allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Each function focuses on one thing, making the overall code easier to follow.</li>
      <li><b>Reduce errors:</b> By using functions, you can avoid repeating the same code, which reduces the chance of making mistakes.</li>
      <li><b>Organize code:</b> Functions help you organize your code by grouping related tasks together. This makes it easier to find and update code later on.</li>
      <li><b>Simplify debugging:</b> Functions allow you to test and fix small parts of your code at a time, making it easier to find and fix errors.</li>
    </ul>
