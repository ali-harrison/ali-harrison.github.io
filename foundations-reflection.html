    <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
    <ul>
      <b>New things i've learnt about myself</b>
      <li>
        I've come to realize that I'm not particularly fond of talking about
        myself or acknowledging my achievements. It's just not something that
        comes naturally to me. However, my experience with Foundations has been
        quite enlightening in this regard. Despite my initial discomfort, I've
        found that the program has helped me become much more comfortable with
        both talking about myself and recognizing my accomplishments. In a way,
        I've been pushed out of my comfort zone, and while it hasn't been easy,
        I can see how valuable this growth has been for me.
      </li>

      <b
        >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
        and programming?</b
      >
      <li>
        <b>Values:</b> Values are like your personal compass, guiding you in
        programming. They help you make good choices and focus on what's
        important, like writing clear and honest code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Empathy:</b> Empathy means understanding how others feel. In
        programming, it helps you create software that's easy for people to use
        and work well with others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Self-awareness:</b> Self-awareness is knowing your own strengths,
        weaknesses, and feelings. It helps you set goals, improve, and handle
        challenges better in programming.
      </li>

      <b>What has suprised me most during core learning</b>
      <li>
        I've been pleasantly surprised by the significant impact the core
        learning has had on my daily life. It's made me reconsider how I
        approach everyday tasks and activities. I've found myself changing the
        way I do things, from simple daily routines to more complex tasks, all
        because of the new perspectives and skills I've gained from the learning
        process.
      </li>

      <b>Most challenging aspects of core</b>
      <li>
        Learning core aspects was tough because these foundational concepts are
        often complex and require deep understanding. They're detailed and
        fundamental, demanding a lot of time and effort to master. These core
        ideas are also interconnected with other concepts in the subject, making
        it hard to grasp them without understanding related topics. Applying
        these core aspects to solve problems requires critical thinking and
        creativity. Lastly, retaining these foundational concepts over time can
        be challenging, especially if they're not frequently revisited or
        applied.

      <b
        >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b
      >
      <li>
        the emphasis on core learning in our Bootcamp course is setting us up
        for long-term success by providing us with a strong foundation,
        essential skills, and a comprehensive understanding of web development
        principles.
      </li>
      <b>Time spent learning core</b>
      <li>
        the time spent studying core learning in a web development course was
        essential for building a solid foundation in programming. It lays the
        groundwork for effective practice and sets us students up for long-term
        success .
