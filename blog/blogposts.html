    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

    <h3>28 March 2024</h3>

    <p>
      Heres how i first thought of it. Imagine you're decorating a room. Margin
      is like the space between your furniture and the walls, ensuring things
      don't feel cramped and allowing each piece to stand out on its own. Border
      is like the frame around a picture, outlining and defining the shape of
      each item in your room. It gives a sense of structure and organization to
      your layout. Padding is like the cushioning on your furniture, providing a
      comfortable and visually pleasing space between you and the edges. It adds
      a sense of depth and dimension to your decor, making everything look
      well-arranged and inviting. Together, margin, border, and padding work
      harmoniously to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing room layout!
