    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Neuroplasticity</b> means your brain can change and grow when you learn
      new things or experience new stuff. Understanding this helps you know that
      you can improve your brainpower at any age. You can do this by trying new
      things, exercising, and staying curious.</li>

      <b>To benefit from this</b>, you can do activities that challenge your
      brain, like learning a new skill or playing puzzles. These things help
      create new connections in your brain, making you smarter and more
      adaptable. Some ways to boost your brain's flexibility are learning new
      things, staying active, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep.

      <li><b>Growth mindset</b> is the idea that you can get smarter and better at
      things if you work hard and keep trying. This is important because it
      helps you stay positive and keep going even when things are tough. You can
      use this mindset in your learning by seeing mistakes as opportunities to
      learn and by believing in your ability to improve. It's about staying
      curious, trying new things, and not giving up when things get hard. One
      good book about this is "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol
      Dweck. It explains how having a growth mindset can help you succeed in
      many areas of your life. In your learning plan, you can use these ideas by
      trying new things, staying positive, and seeing challenges as
      opportunities to grow. By doing this, you can improve your brain's
      flexibility and your ability to learn new things.</li>
