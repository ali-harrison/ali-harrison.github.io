      <h1>Identity Values</h1>
      <p>
        <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>

        An ethical decision that I have consciously made recently is not purchasing from big companies that are profiting off consumerism. This means that I am now buying clothing from ethical businesses, that are preferably local. Reflecting on this decision, I now feel that I am contributing to my local economy and not fast fashion. 
        
        
       <h4> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
        
        Raised by a village - Bluff lots of family and raised in a marae environmemt.  I know my Ngai Tahu values and whakapapa.
        High school years in Rotorua - this allowed me to connect with my Tuhourangi whakapapa.  
        I know where I belong, I know who my whanau are.  Our values of manaaki and whanaungatanga are our strong points.
        
        
        
        
        <h4>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h4>
        
        I am a hardworker and quick learner.
        I can be disciplined when i need to be.
        I am reliable in the sense of doing whats asked of me.
        
        
        
        
        <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
        
        Sometimes I dont like to ask questions - this may limit my development.
